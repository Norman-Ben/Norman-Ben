### Hi there I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a full stack web developer working at an IT services provider, where I work on a variety of full stack development projects, both internal and customer facing. Outside of this, I also freelance, creating web applications for various clients and industries. I am experienced in both the front end and back end of the tech stack, using technologies such as React, TypeScript, Node.JS and both SQL and NoSQL databases. Check out my portfolio to see some of my work or contact me to discuss your project needs!
